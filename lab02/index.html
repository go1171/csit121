            <h2>Lab 2</h2>
            <p>The assignment was very straightforward with the directions provided.
            The reference material I used helped me quickly format the HTML and build the page. 
            The hardest thing for me was expressing my thoughts in this reflection.
            I don't currently have any questions about the assignment, and I look forward to learning more as I progress through the class.</p>
