            <p>The assignment was very straightforward with the directions provided.
            The reference material I used helped me quickly format the HTML and build the page. 
            The hardest thing for me was expressing my thoughts in this reflection.
            I don't currently have any questions about the assignment, and I look forward to learning more as I progress through the class.</p>
            <p>In this assignment I learned how to style a HTML document using CSS. 
            CSS makes it easier to manage styles of the HTML document because it keeps the styling outside the HTML to make it less cluttered. 
            Using selectors I can pick and choose which styles I want for specific pieces of text in the HTML document. 
            With CSS I can make my HTML document look more visually appealing and easier to read for any viewer of the page. </p>
